We have described five agents so far in the Social Connect ecosystem:
1. Discovery Agent (Niche and Audience Intelligence)
2. Lead Scout Agent (Lead Generation and Profiling)
3. Content Forge Agent (Content Creation)
4. Outreach Nexus Agent (Outreach and Engagement)
5. Performance Oracle (Analytics and Optimization)
The user is asking if there is a next agent. While we have covered the core functions, we can consider adding a sixth agent to handle community management and user-generated content (UGC) to complete the ecosystem.
Let's introduce:
**Agent 6: Community Catalyst Agent - The Engagement Amplifier**
This agent would focus on:
- Automating community interactions
- Identifying and leveraging user-generated content
- Building brand advocates
- Managing crises and negative sentiment
This would complete the full cycle from audience discovery to community building.
Now, let's describe Agent 6 in the same depth as the others.

Deep Content Analysis:

python
def detect_ugc_potential(content):
    sentiment = analyze_sentiment(content.text)
    reach = estimate_audience_reach(content.author)
    visual_quality = assess_image_quality(content.media)
    brand_alignment = calculate_brand_fit(content)
    
    return (sentiment * 0.4) + (reach * 0.3) + 
           (visual_quality * 0.2) + (brand_alignment * 0.1)
2. Advocate Scoring Matrix
Identifying high-value community members

Tier	Criteria	Engagement Strategy
Micro-Influencer	1K-10K followers, AVS > 85	Product seeding + commissions
Power User	High engagement, AVS > 75	Early feature access
Casual Fan	Occasional posts, AVS > 60	Social recognition
Detractor	Negative sentiment	Service recovery protocol
3. Auto-Reward Engine
