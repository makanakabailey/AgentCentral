We have described four agents so far:
1. Discovery Agent (Niche and Audience Intelligence)
2. Lead Scout Agent (Lead Generation and Profiling)
3. Content Forge Agent (Content Creation)
4. Outreach Nexus Agent (Outreach and Engagement)
The user is asking if there is a next agent. Based on the initial plan and the comprehensive system we are building, there is indeed a fifth agent that handles performance analytics and optimization.
Let me introduce:
### **Agent 5: Performance Oracle - The Predictive Optimization Engine**

### **2. Predictive Modeler**  
*Campaign outcome forecasting*  
**Revenue Prediction Model:**  
```python
def predict_revenue(campaign):
    # Feature engineering
    features = extract_features(campaign)
    
    # Ensemble modeling
    prophet_forecast = fb_prophet.predict(features)
    lstm_forecast = tf_lstm.predict(features)
    
    # Confidence-weighted blending
    return (prophet_forecast * 0.7) + (lstm_forecast * 0.3)
```
**Accuracy Boosters:**  
- Cross-validation with temporal splits

```
**Optimization Levers:**  
- Content type and format adjustments  
- Audience targeting refinement  
- Channel mix reallocation  
- Budget distribution optimization

### **5. Resource Allocation AI**  
*Intelligent effort distribution*  
**Dynamic Budget Assignment:**  
`Channel Budget = (Historical ROAS × 0.4) + (Predicted Scalability × 0.3) + (Engagement Quality × 0.3)`  
**Effort Optimization Matrix:**  
| **Metric**           | **Resource Action**                |  
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|  
| ROAS > 4.0            | Increase budget 20-40%             |  
| CTR < 0.8%            | Pause and redesign creatives       |  
| Conversion < 1.2%     | Trigger Agent 2 for lead rescue    |  
| Engagement ↓ 30%      | Deploy Agent 3 content refresh     |
