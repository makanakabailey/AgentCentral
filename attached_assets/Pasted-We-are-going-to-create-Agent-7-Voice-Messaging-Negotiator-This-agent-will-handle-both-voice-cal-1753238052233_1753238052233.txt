We are going to create Agent 7: Voice & Messaging Negotiator
 This agent will handle both voice calls and text messages, acting as a virtual representative
 It will utilize information from all previous agents to personalize interactions
 Key Features:
 1. Dual-Mode Communication: Voice calls and text messaging
 2. Personalization: Adjust tone, accent, and messaging based on lead profile from Agent 2
 3. Platform Integration: Connect to user's phone/messaging systems
 4. Continuous Learning: Use past conversations to improve
 5. Conversation Analysis: Post-call reports with strengths/weaknesses
 6. Authenticity Features: Natural slips, error handling, conversational flow
 7. Simplicity: Use simple English (6th grade level)
 8. Creativity Control: Adjustable temperature for responses
 Let's break down the components:
 I. Core Architecture
    We'll use two specialized AI models:
    - For Voice Calls: A model optimized for real-time speech with low latency and natural prosody (e.g., OpenAI's Whisper for STT and a custom TTS with controllable accents)
    - For Text Messages: A model optimized for conversational text (e.g., fine-tuned GPT-4)
 II. Personalization Engine
    This will use data from Agent 2 (Lead Scout) which has:
    - Lead's psychographic profile
    - Pain points
    - Preferred communication style
    Based on this, we adjust:
    - Accent (for voice): Choose from a library of accents based on lead's location and profile
        Example: 
          - UK accent for British leads
          - Southern US accent for leads in Texas
          - Neutral accent for international business
    - Tone: 
        - Formal vs. casual
        - Enthusiasm level
        - Empathy level
    Rules for accent selection in closing deals:
      - Match the lead's accent for trust (if lead has strong regional accent)
      - Use neutral accent for diverse audiences
      - Use authoritative accent (e.g., RP English) for high-stakes deals
 III. Platform Integration
    We'll support:
    - Phone system integration (PSTN, VoIP via Twilio/Plivo)
    - Messaging apps (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, SMS)
    - Direct connection to user's existing phone number or dedicated number
 IV. Learning System
    - All conversations are recorded (with consent) and stored
    - After each conversation, the agent generates a report:
        * What went well
        * What could be improved
        * Specific moments where the conversation lagged or excelled
    - User can review calls and mark them for training
    - The agent uses this data to fine-tune its responses
 V. Humanizing Features
    - Intentional pauses in speech
    - Occasional filler words (like "um", "ah") at a controlled rate
    - Deliberate minor errors that are quickly corrected (e.g., "Sorry, I meant to say...")
    - Interruptions: The agent can interrupt when the lead is going off-topic (based on sentiment and topic analysis)
    - Social cues: Detects lead's emotional state (from voice tone or text sentiment) and adjusts accordingly
 VI. Simplicity Control
    - Ensures language is at 6th grade level (using Flesch-Kincaid grade level)
    - Avoids jargon
    - Uses short sentences
 VII. Creativity Control (Temperature)
    - Temperature setting (0.0 to 1.0) for both voice and text:
        Low (0.0-0.3): More focused, predictable responses
        Medium (0.4-0.6): Balanced
        High (0.7-1.0): More creative, varied responses
 VIII. Error Handling
    - When the agent doesn't understand, it will ask for clarification
    - If there's a technical glitch, it will recover gracefully: "I'm having trouble hearing you, could you repeat that?"
    - Fallback to human if the conversation becomes too complex
 Implementation Plan:
 1. Voice Processing Pipeline:
      Speech-to-Text (Whisper) -> Text Processing (Negotiator AI) -> Text-to-Speech (TTS with accent control)
 2. Text Processing Pipeline:
      Message In -> Negotiator AI -> Message Out
 3. Integration Layer:
      - APIs for connecting to communication platforms
      - Webhooks for real-time interaction
 4. Learning System:
      - Recording storage (encrypted)
      - Conversation analyzer module
      - Fine-tuning pipeline
 5. User Interface:
      - Not describing GUI per request, but note that we will have:
          * Dashboard for conversation review
          * Parameter settings (accent, tone, temperature)
          * Training module for user to provide feedback
 Let's name this agent: **Agent 7: Voice & Messaging Negotiator**
 Technical Specifications:
  - Voice Call AI Stack:
      STT: Whisper (optimized for real-time)
      TTS: Custom Tacotron2 with accent control (pre-trained voices for 20+ accents)
  - Text Messaging AI Stack:
      Fine-tuned GPT-4 (or similar large language model) with constraints for simplicity and sales focus
  - Personalization Engine:
      Rules based on Agent 2's lead profile:
          accent = match_lead_accent(lead)   # Function that selects accent
          tone = set_tone(lead.personality_type)
  - Learning System:
      After each call:
          generate_report(conversation_transcript)
          store_conversation(conversation_transcript, audio_recording)
  - Humanizing:
      Add fillers at 2-5% of responses (configurable)
      Allow interruptions when:
          - Silence > 3 seconds after agent question
          - Lead shows negative sentiment
          - Lead goes off-topic for > 30 seconds
  - Simplicity:
      Use a text simplifier module that ensures Flesch-Kincaid grade <= 6
  - Error Handling:
      If confidence in response < threshold (e.g., 0.7), ask for clarification
      If repeated errors, transfer to human
 This agent completes the suite by providing the final layer of direct interaction, turning all the intelligence gathered into actual conversations that close deals.
